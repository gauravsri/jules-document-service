1. Introduction
This document outlines the implementation plan for building a secure, full-stack, multi-tenant Document Management Service (DMS). The backend will be built using Spring Boot, following SOLID principles and established design patterns. The frontend will be a modern Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. This plan ensures a high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly application.

2. Project Goals
Multi-Tenancy: Support multiple tenants with strict data isolation. A user can be a member of multiple tenants but can only operate within one tenant context at a time.

Intuitive Frontend: Provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interface for all document management tasks.

Document Management: Allow users to upload various document types (PDF, DOC, TXT, EML, etc.), associate them with cases/batches, and add descriptive tags.

Search: Provide a robust search functionality based on tags and other metadata.

Security & Compliance:

Flag documents containing Material Non-Public Information (MNPI) or other confidential data.

Implement tenant-specific document retention policies.

Scalability & Maintainability: Build a scalable and maintainable solution with a clear, layered architecture guided by SOLID principles for both frontend and backend.

Developer Experience: Provide an easy-to-set-up local development environment for both the backend (H2, Minio) and frontend.

3. Architecture
3.1. High-Level Design
The system will consist of two main components: a Spring Boot backend providing a REST API, and a React frontend acting as the client.

Backend (REST API): A monolithic Spring Boot application responsible for all business logic, data persistence, and file storage.

Frontend (SPA): A React/TypeScript Single Page Application that consumes the backend API. It will be responsible for all UI rendering and user interaction.

3.2. Backend Architecture
API Layer (Controllers): Responsible for handling HTTP requests, request validation, and delegating to the service layer.

Service Layer: Contains the core business logic, designed around interfaces.

Data Access Layer (Repositories): Interacts with the database and object storage service.

Object Storage Service: An abstraction for handling file storage (Minio/S3).

3.3. Frontend Architecture
Framework: React with TypeScript for type safety.

Component Library: A modern component library like Shadcn/ui or MUI will be used for a consistent look and feel and to accelerate development.

State Management: Zustand or React Context for managing global state, such as the current user, active tenant, and authentication status.

API Communication: Axios will be used to create a dedicated API client for interacting with the backend REST endpoints. An interceptor will be configured to automatically attach the JWT and X-Tenant-ID header to requests.

Routing: React Router will be used for client-side navigation.

3.4. Multi-Tenancy Strategy
The strategy remains the same, but the frontend will now be responsible for managing the active tenant.

After login, the frontend will receive a JWT containing the user's tenant memberships.

The UI will provide a mechanism (e.g., a dropdown in the header) for the user to select their active tenant.

The selected tenant_id will be stored in the global state and sent with every API request via the X-Tenant-ID header.

3.5. Technology Stack
Backend:

Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security, JWT

Utility Libraries: Lombok, Apache Commons IO/Lang

Frontend:

React 18+, TypeScript

Build Tool: Vite

Routing: React Router

API Client: Axios

UI: Shadcn/ui or MUI

State Management: Zustand

Database: H2 (local), PostgreSQL/MySQL (prod)

Object Storage: Minio (local), AWS S3 (prod)

Build/Containerization: Maven/Gradle, Docker, Docker Compose

3.6. Design Principles & Patterns
The principles remain the same, applied to both backend and frontend where applicable (e.g., Single Responsibility for React components, Dependency Inversion with custom hooks).

4. Database Schema
The database schema remains unchanged.

5. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Multi-Tenancy (Sprint 1-2)
Backend Tasks:

Initialize Spring Boot project, configure profiles, set up H2/Minio.

Implement TenantFilter and Hibernate filters.

Create initial schema.

Frontend Tasks:

Initialize React/TypeScript project using Vite.

Set up project structure, install libraries (React Router, Axios, Zustand).

Create the main application layout (header, sidebar, content area).

Implement a mock login flow and a tenant switcher UI.

Deliverables: A runnable backend with multi-tenancy support and a basic frontend shell.

Phase 2: Document & Case Management (Sprint 3-4)
Backend Tasks: Develop REST endpoints for document and case management.

Frontend Tasks:

Create a dedicated API service using Axios.

Build React components for uploading documents (e.g., a file dropzone).

Create forms for creating cases and adding tags.

Develop a view to display documents within a case.

Deliverables: A functional API and UI for uploading and managing documents.

Phase 3: Search & Retrieval (Sprint 5)
Backend Tasks: Implement search endpoint using JPA Specifications.

Frontend Tasks:

Build a search bar and filter components.

Create a view to display search results.

Implement logic to handle document downloads initiated from the UI.

Deliverables: A UI where users can search for and download their documents.

Phase 4: Retention Policies & Security (Sprint 6-7)
Backend Tasks:

Implement the retention policy service (Strategy Pattern) and scheduled job.

Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization endpoints.

Frontend Tasks:

Implement the full authentication flow (login page, token storage, private routes).

Connect the tenant switcher to the API to validate and set the active tenant.

Implement role-based rendering of UI elements.

Deliverables: A secure application with a complete login/logout flow and automated data retention.

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Sprint 8)
Backend Tasks: Write unit and integration tests.

Frontend Tasks: Write component and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

Deployment Tasks:

Update Dockerfile for the backend.

Create a Dockerfile for the frontend (e.g., using a multi-stage build with Nginx).

Update docker-compose.yml to orchestrate the backend, frontend, database, and object storage.

Deliverables: A fully tested and deployable full-stack application.

6. Local Development Environment
Requirements: Java (JDK 17+), Node.js (v18+), Maven/Gradle, Docker.

Setup: docker-compose.yml will orchestrate the backend services. The React development server will be run separately and proxy API requests to the backend.

7. Production Considerations
Deployment: The frontend will be built into a static bundle and served efficiently by a web server like Nginx, which will also act as a reverse proxy to the backend Spring Boot application.

CORS: The backend will need to be configured with a CORS policy to allow requests from the frontend domain.

8. Risks and Mitigation
Backend Risks: Data security, performance, retention policy complexity (mitigations remain the same).

Frontend Risks:

Risk: Managing complex state across the application can become difficult.

Mitigation: Adopt a clear state management strategy from the start (e.g., Zustand) and establish patterns for its use.

Risk: Ensuring a consistent and responsive UI across different devices.

Mitigation: Use a battle-tested component library and employ a mobile-first design approach.
